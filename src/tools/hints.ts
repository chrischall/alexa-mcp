/**
 * Context-group hints, published on each tool as `_meta.mint` (the mcp-host
 * context-groups contract, `mintHintSchema`). Inert data: a host that does not
 * read them sees an extra `_meta` key and nothing else. The shape is fixed by
 * the host's contract, so it is restated here rather than imported — this
 * server takes no dependency on mcp-host.
 *
 * `subject` and `when` name THIS tool's own argument names (the host fills
 * them), never values; `aliases` are the words a person says — lowercase, at
 * most 8, each at most 40 chars. Every tool here is in the `home` group. No
 * tool names a `subject`: Echo devices and lists are things a command runs ON,
 * not whose news a person asks after.
